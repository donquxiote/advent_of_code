# Advent of Code

Storage of my puzzle solutions. Branches will be different years. 


# TODO

Would be nice to have boiler plate code to generate file structure like so:

Day 1
|- input.txt
|- solution.ex
|- output.txt


Add https://github.com/J0B10/aoc-badges-action badges to this project
Use https://github.com/breakthatbass/eggnog eggnog for managing/submitting puzzles
